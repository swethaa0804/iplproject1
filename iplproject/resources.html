                        <p>Coding interviews are an important part of various software engineering, machine learning, and data science jobs. Most of the candidates are good at using programming for their daily-life research problems. But when it comes to a coding interview one needs to brush up on the basics of different data structures since most of the problems revolve around selecting the right data structure for the given problem.</p>

                        <p>It is very essential to cover all the fundamentals of DBMS and SQL cover all the DBMS concepts in deep, more theoritical based. If you have enough time, you can read some common DBMS interview questions and try some SQL problems on Leet Code.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Most programmers need to realise the importance of datastructures as early as possible in their course work. The knowledge of this subject helps us grow as better programmers and master computer science. On another side, the interviewer uses DS to test candidates during the interview. It provides them a simple approach to evaluate problem solving skills and clarity of thought. So mastering data structure requires proper guidance and continuous learning plan.</p>
